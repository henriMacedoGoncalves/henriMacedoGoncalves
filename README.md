Hi, my name is Henri Macedo Gon√ßalves and I'm in my third year of Computer Science at the University of Strasbourg.

Originally from Luxembourg, I am currently looking for Internships related to Communication, Web Development or Data Management.
My university helped me building a solid foundation in those domains and I am interested to expand my skills in real-world problems.

In my free time, I like to do Calisthenics, read (mostly self-educating) books and occasionally play video games.
Calisthenics strengthen my mind to be disciplined and dedicated. It also frees me mentally from work. Reading widens my knowledge and understanding in all aspects of life.
Video games offers moments of relaxation.

The main goal behind my GitHub profile is to highlight what projects I've done at school and to show where my interests lie.
Some of them were group projects and some had to be done alone.

For any question, feel free to contact me by [email](mailto:henri.macedogoncalves@gmail.com) or reach me on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henri-macedo-gon%C3%A7alves-182449264/).
